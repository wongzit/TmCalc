# Tm.Calc
![](TmCalc_wide.png)

Latest version: **1.0.1**, updated at 2022-01-25

## Usage

Input sequences separated by comma (','), and press ENTER key.

```
Input menu number to modify concentration, or input primer sequences:
e.g.: ATCGGACTAGACGAT,AGGGTCTTACAGAGCT,GGGCTTTAGAATAGA
>>> (User input) ATCGGACTAGACGAT,AGGGTCTTACAGAGCT
```

The GC% and Tm calculated with Nearest neighbor, Wallace and GC% methods would be displayed as following:
```
Sequence: ATCGGACTAGACGAT
GC = 46.7%, Length = 15
---------- Melting Temperature ----------
      Nearest Neighbor Method: 46.4
               Wallace Method: 44.0
                   GC% Method: 45.7

Sequence: AGGGTCTTACAGAGCT
GC = 50.0%, Length = 16
---------- Melting Temperature ----------
      Nearest Neighbor Method: 48.3
               Wallace Method: 48.0
                   GC% Method: 49.2
```

## Modify Parameters

The default concentrations are 50 mM of salt and 500 nM of primer. 
Users can modify these concentration by input menu number at first.

```
===================================
       Concentration Setting       
-----------------------------------
   1 - Salt conc. = 50 mM             <<<--- Default concentration of salt
   2 - Primer conc. = 500 nM          <<<--- Default concentration of primer
===================================
Input menu number to modify concentration, or input primer sequences:
e.g.: ATCGGACTAGACGAT,AGGGTCTTACAGAGCT,GGGCTTTAGAATAGA
1       <<<--- Modify the salt concentration
Input the concentration of salt, in mM:60       <<<--- Input the salt concentration

===================================
       Concentration Setting       
-----------------------------------
   1 - Salt conc. = 60.0 mM           <<<--- Modified concentration of salt
   2 - Primer conc. = 500 nM
===================================
Input menu number to modify concentration, or input primer sequences:
e.g.: ATCGGACTAGACGAT,AGGGTCTTACAGAGCT,GGGCTTTAGAATAGA
